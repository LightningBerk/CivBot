# CivBot
A collection of AdvancedMarcros scripts made for botting and automation on Civ servers
These script are free to use and distribute :)
# How to use
You will need to install the Advanced macros mod found [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-macros/files/all)
Once you have run your game once with the mod installed you will find a folder labeled "advancedMacros" in your mods folder. This is where you will put any scripts you want to use. All you need to do now is configure your controls for the mod and start bottting some stuff!
# Documentation
I have put comments in my code explaining how it works as best I can. The scripts also have instructions that are sent in the chat, so pay attention to those. Feel free to messafe me on discord with any questions, LightningBerk#2809
